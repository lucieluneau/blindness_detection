# Blindness Detection: 

Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.

Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospitalâ€™s ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium

We used a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.
A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - No DR
  
1 - Mild
  
2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferative DR
