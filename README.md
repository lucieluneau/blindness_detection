# Blindness Detection: 

Imagine being able to detect blindness before it happened.

Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct. Successful entries in this competition will improve the hospitalâ€™s ability to identify potential patients. Further, the solutions will be spread to other Ophthalmologists through the 4th Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS) Symposium

We used a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.
A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:

0 - No DR
  
1 - Mild
  
2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferative DR

- Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/matheuseduardo/preprocessed-2019-blindness-detection

- Type of analysis: A basic CNN to classify the data between the 4 stages of the disease 


Please document the project the better you can.

# Stratup the project

The initial setup.

Create virtualenv and install the project:
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
  $ deactivate; virtualenv ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate ;\
    pip install pip -U; pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Unittest test:
```bash
  $ make clean install test
```

Check for blindness_detection in gitlab.com/{group}.
If your project is not set please add it:

- Create a new project on `gitlab.com/{group}/blindness_detection`
- Then populate it:

```bash
  $ ##   e.g. if group is "{group}" and project_name is "blindness_detection"
  $ git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:{group}/blindness_detection.git
  $ git push -u origin master
  $ git push -u origin --tags
```

Functionnal test with a script:
```bash
  $ cd /tmp
  $ blindness_detection-run
```
# Install
Go to `gitlab.com/{group}/blindness_detection` to see the project, manage issues,
setup you ssh public key, ...

Create a python3 virtualenv and activate it:
```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-pip python-dev
  $ deactivate; virtualenv -ppython3 ~/venv ; source ~/venv/bin/activate
```

Clone the project and install it:
```bash
  $ git clone gitlab.com/{group}/blindness_detection
  $ cd blindness_detection
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ make clean install test                # install and test
```
Functionnal test with a script:
```bash
  $ cd /tmp
  $ blindness_detection-run
```
